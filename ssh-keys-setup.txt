 ------------------------ What is SSH? ------------------------------
SSH is a way to authenticate without exposing your username and password of GitLab.
SSH stands for Secure Shell and is a cryptographic protocol based on the concept of public-private keys.
We are using SSH with Git because it is much easier than typing your username and password all the time, 
and it is also more secure.You have probably noticed that GitLab is complaining that you donâ€™t have an SSH key.


----------------------- Steps to Setup SSH key in window 10 ------------------------------------
Type the Commands

1. ssh-keygen // First, you will be asked about the location where the keys should be stored. 
                By default, your user folder will contain a folder called .ssh. Leave it as it 
                and hit the Enter key.


id_rsa ===> this is your PRIVATE key. DO NOT SHARE this with anyone else. This is your secret.
id_rsa.pub ===> this is your PUBLIC key. This contains no secrets. You can share it with others.


2. Adding your SSH key to GitLab
   i) Open Window powershell and type the below command
   ii) cat C:\Users\username\.ssh\id_rsa.pub    // open the .pub file and copy all the text

3. Open GitLab Go to-->Setting-->Profile-->SSH keys
   and paste your public key



----------------------- Steps to Setup SSH key in Linux ------------------------------------

Same as Window 10 Commands


----------------------- Steps to Setup SSH key in MacOS ------------------------------------


First You need to install homebrew
-->Just go bres.sh and copy the command and paste in mac terminal

1. brew install git // installing git

2. ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
   // -t to specify the RSA encryption algorithm
   // -b to specify the key size in bits.

3. Follow same as window 10 instructions
